#death-by-a-1000-javascript-cuts
### AKA = DBATJSCUTS
===============================


## How did this concept come about?
I was reading a blog post from Wes Bos where he was asked a question about how to get better a at javascript - his reply was make a 1000s things in JavaScript and I thought WOW death by a thousand JavaScript cuts and so that was the birth of this repository.


## What is it?
Well bluntly put this repository is for me - it is about me exercising my JavaScript muscles.
It is about me having fun and trying out any idea in my head.
It is what I make it - however I mainly want to do raw/native JS.
It is about doing what I want to do… Simples


## What’s the aim?
The ain or final goal is exactly what it says on the tin - make 1000 JavaScripty things


## Why?
Coz I can and because an JavaScript Engineer, Wes Bos, recommended to get better make lots and lots of things

## What will you find looking at this repository
I do not know... I've not made it yet :p
